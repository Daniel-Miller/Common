# Common .NET Libraries

This repository contains class libraries that implement functionality for common, cross-cutting concerns. These are "bare-metal" libraries, with no third-party references (unless absolutely necessary). The code targets .NET Standard 2.0 to maximize their reuse potential, so you should be able to use them in any .NET Standard, .NET Core, or .NET Framework project: Console, Web, Windows, and/or Library.
